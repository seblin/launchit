# If this executable is invoked, but the launchit package was not installed 
# on the user's system, it needs to put its parent path into `sys.path`, to 
# assure that the subsequent import of launchit will not fail. However, in 
# case that an installation was made before, adding this executable's parent
# directory to the python path would result in nonsense (`/usr/bin/launchit` 
# would become `/usr`). Hence, the parent path is checked for a sub-directory
# named `launchit`, assuming that this is the launchit package and only then
# a new entry is added to the beginning of `sys.path`. Note that this also
# means that the executable, when invoked "locally", is guaranteed to use the 
# "local" version of launchit, even if there is an existing installation.
