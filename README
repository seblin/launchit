Launchit's current state is more or less just a basic idea like how a launcher 
could be implemented in Python. Launchit needs at least Python 2.6 and PySide 
to be installed in order to run. It is currently focused on Linux systems, 
where xdg-open is used to detect the desired program, when a non-executable 
file is needed to be invoked. Since Launchit separates its internal logic from 
the graphical presentation, it is possible to run it without PySide, just using
core.py as a stand-alone file. However, to do tests inside the (yet poorly 
implemented) GUI, user's may run `python -m launchit.gui` from a terminal,
assuming that Launchit was copied in a subfolder named "launchit".
