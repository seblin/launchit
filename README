Launchit's current state is more or less just a basic idea like how a launcher 
could be implemented in Python. Some of its features include the following:

* Launchit is able to suggest possible completions for given fragments. 
  The fragment itself will then appear as marked (i.e. underlined and bold) 
  inside the completion.

* Launchit supports icon name guessing, when a completion is selected. 
  Currently an appropriate icon is retrieved by a look inside the user's 
  menu entries. More abilities will follow...

* Various file-types are launched inside the user's preferred application,
  using the desktop environment's specific launcher to make the right choice.

Launchit depends on PyXDG and PySide. Unfortunately, both do not (yet) support
Python 3.x, so Launchit only runs under Python 2.x (at least 2.6).

Note that Launchit is focused on Linux systems. Support for other platforms
(e.g. Windows) may be implemented at a later state.

You can test Launchit by just running its GUI via the repo's `bin/launchit` 
file. Feel free to give some feedback on it. :-)
